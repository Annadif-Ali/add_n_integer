What is a Recursion?
Recursion in C++ is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
This approach is often used for problems that can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems.
A recursive function typically has two main components:
Base Case: A condition under which the function will stop calling itself, preventing infinite recursion.
Recursive Case: The part of the function where it calls itself with modified arguments to gradually approach the base case.
